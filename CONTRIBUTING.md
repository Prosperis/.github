## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### General

- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Keep functions small and focused

- Remove console.logs before committing

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use **ES6+** syntax

- Use **async/await** over callbacks
- Follow the existing formatting (Prettier/ESLint if configured)

### React

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety (if the project uses it)
- Follow component naming conventions: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for functions
